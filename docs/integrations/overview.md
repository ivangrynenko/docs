* Automatic push of content when it changes
* Support for taxonomies, categories, tags
* Support for files/media
* Redirects support
* Scheduled content release
* Automatic, seamless integrated [Search](/docs/dashboard/search)
* ... much more!

Get started with either [Drupal](/docs/integrations/drupal) or [Wordpress](/docs/integrations/wordpress).

If you are already using a static generator then integrate with the [CLI tool](/docs/cli/get-started).
