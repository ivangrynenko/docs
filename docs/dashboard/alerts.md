Sitewide alerts allow you to add a project wide banner at the top of every page.

This can be useful when using Quant as a failover solution, or for any other reason you need to inject a quick alert message sitewide without the need to re-seed all site content.

Navigate to the "Alert editor" section in the dashboard navigation. Simply enable and configure with title and message body (markup supported).

A future release will contain additional functionality to control look and feel, scheduling, and more.
